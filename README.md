# Product-Market-Fit-Analysis

## Introduction:

In the crowded marketplace of ideas and innovations, many products launch with a fanfare, only to fade into obscurity. Why? Often, it's a simple, yet overlooked truth: they weren't built for anyone in particular.

The pursuit of Product Market Fit (PMF) is not just a buzzword, it’s the lifeline of any successful venture. It’s the moment your product resonates so deeply with a specific market that it becomes indispensable. And at the heart of this connection lies one fundamental principle, “building for your customers.”
Therefore, there are key metrics every startup must track in other to attain Product Market fit(aka building for your customers). The essence of this project is to track some of these key metrics that evaluate if a startup is either product market fit or not.


## Key Metrics:

1. What is the Average Retention Rate 
2. What is the Churn Rate
3. Customer’s Engagement Rate
4. MoM customer Acquisition
5. Comparison of the Churn Rate and the Retention Rate
6. Need Analysis

## Skills/ concepts demonstrated:

- Data Gathering

### Analysis:

### What is the Average Retention Rate

The average customer retention rate for the analyzed startups stands at a concerning 41.3%. This figure significantly underperforms the industry standard of 60%, highlighting a substantial gap in the startups' ability to maintain their existing customer base. 

The stark contrast suggests that, while some customers may find value in the offerings, a considerable portion (nearly 60%) are not sufficiently engaged or satisfied to remain active on the platforms over time. This indicates a potential weakness in customer loyalty and the overall stickiness of the startups' products or services compared to established benchmarks in the industry.

### What is the Churn Rate

The average customer churn rate of 13.45% for these early-stage startups falls within the generally accepted industry benchmark for similar ventures, which typically ranges from 10% to 15%. This suggests that, despite the inherent risks and adjustments common in the early stages of a business, the rate at which customers are discontinuing their use of the startups' products or services is currently within the expected parameters for this phase of growth.
Though the figure is expected to be higher than this, however the 46% unaccounted for is as a result of calculation being done off different cohorts

### Product Analysis:

### Customer’s engagement Rate

The average customer engagement rate is 37.0% but in comparison to each startup, Startup 1 had the highest customer engagement rate of about 40.54%, Followed by Startup 2, with about 37.84% and then startup 


### Comparison of the Churn Rate and the Retention Rate

Though the Retention rate is a bit low, in individual comparison with the churn rate for each startup, the retention rate is fair. Most especially, for the first startup having a wide margin and startup 2 & 3 with a more slimmer margin. 

It can therefore be inferred that the average of  41.3% which is considered to be low is as a result of the non-existence of users, as well as any retention rate for startup 4 and 5.  And this can be as a result of these startups being in an early MVP stage.


### MoM customer Acquisition

The observed Month-on-Month  customer acquisition rate of 5% reveals a notably sluggish growth trajectory in the startups' ability to attract new users. This consistently low acquisition figure strongly suggests a potential backwardness in the product's overall visibility within the target market. 

The current marketing efforts may be inadequate to effectively reach and engage potential customers, hindering the necessary influx of new users required for sustainable growth and market penetration.


### Need Analysis

From the Analysis, it was discovered that only 3 startups were actually solving a need, whereas the other startups were averagely solving a need for their target market. This specific data point was transformed from a qualitative form to a quantitative form  through the consultation of a subject matter expert (in this case, a Venture Capitalist)

## Conclusion and Recommendations:

I think generally, an overall assessment is indicating that a few of the startups are product market fit. However, I would recommend the following.

For the startups that ticked off other metrics but didn’t have a good Month on Month (MoM) growth rate , they can eject more funds into the marketing efforts. This is because, if the churn rate isn't as high, it means that the customers are hooked to the product, indicating that it is addressing a need. So enough money could go into marketing so the product can reach even more eyes.

Whereas for the startups that had 0 statistics, now is the time to launch the  Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to early adopters for a test.
